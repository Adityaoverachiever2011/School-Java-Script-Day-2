</h1>
<h2>
 First Download VSC from the given link.Link:- https://code.visualstudio.com/Download .
 Select The preffered option(I choosed windows).Then allow all the permisions as it is owned by Microsoft. 
 Even I am making this project on VSC.
 Then It will ask you to choose a folder/file. 
 So on the top bar where File, Edit, Selction etc. are written click on file and open folder. 
 Then create a new folder, give a name(optional). Then choose the folder and click "ok/select folder". 
 Then hover your mouse just below edit option and right click. then select "new file". 
 Then type "index.html" for HTML, "style.CSS" for CSS and "main.Js" for JavaScript.
